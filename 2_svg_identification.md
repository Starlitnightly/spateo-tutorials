# Spatially variable genes identificaion

Spateo provides spatially variable genes identificaion by optimal transpotation. One can identify genes do not express spatially uniformly or identify genes have similar spatial expression patterns to specific given genes within a slice. This function has also been extended to spatially variable genes identificaion between two slices.


Here, we introduce two notebooks to show spatially variable genes identification within slice and between two slices respectively:

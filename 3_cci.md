# Cell-cell interaction

Spateo features numerous methods for investigating cell-cell communication from single-cell spatial transcriptomics, 
including

1) Ligand-receptor interaction prediction (by computation of the product) conditioned on spatial proximity (and 
   ligand-receptor enrichment analysis, in the same vein as differential expression to compute spatial 
   region-specific enrichment).
2) Estimation of the impact of niche factors (cell types or ligands/receptors) on expression of genes of interest 
   via spatially-weighted generalized linear modeling.
3) Integration of 2) with downstream modeling to construct networks that marry predictions of intracellular gene 
   regulation with intercellular communication.
